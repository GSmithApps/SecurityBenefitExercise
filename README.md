Exercise 2 : Black-Scholes and OOPS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective: Price different types of Options in Python using Object Oriented Programming

 

Description:

Using the concept of inheritance, price 3 different types of Options, namely:-

1. Call

2. Put

3. Call Spread (consists of 2 call options with different Strikes{Strike cap and Strike floor})

Pricing functions should use Black Scholes model

 

Create a python application/codebase which call the price functions for all 3 option types by assuming the inputs needed in Black Scholes within a reasonable data range.

 

Example Input for Black Sholes Model:

 

#Inputs for Black Scholes Model

spot = 396.86

volatility = 0.0857

growth_rate = 0.001046

discount_rate = 0.00077

dividend = 0

time_to_maturity = 1.0

strike = 392.93

 

Plot the relation between Spot and Call Price in line chart with atleast 5 data points and display the graph in output.

(Hint: Increase/Decrease the Spot with regular interval (keeping all other inputs constant) and note down the Calculated Price. Plot the data set(x:spot levels; y:Call price) in a line chart and display the graph in output)
